Example:

var clientModule = require("woopra/client");
var woopra = new clientModule.WoopraClient("test.scriptr.io");

var params={"eventName":"scriptcall","cookieHash":"","userID":request.user.id,"optionalParamsObj":{"cv_name":"John+Smith","cv_email":"john@mail.com","ce_item":"Coffee+Machine","ce_category":"Electric+Appliances","ce_sku":"K5236532"}};
